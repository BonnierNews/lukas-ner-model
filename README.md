# Evaluation of KB-BERT for Swedish NER
<img align="right" width="200" height="330" src="images/bert.png">
This repository will be populated with work aiming to investigate the Swedish BERT model (KB-BERT), specifically its performance at named entity recognition (NER) for news articles and possible improvements to enhance it in the domain. The exact model evaluated is <b>bert-base-swedish-cased-ner</b>.<br/><br/>
